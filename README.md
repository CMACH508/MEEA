# Efficient retrosynthetic planning with MCTS exploration enhanced A* search

This is open-source codebase for MEEA*-PC (https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-024-01133-2). MEEA* is proposed to incorporate the exploratory behavior of MCTS into A* by providing a look-ahead search. Path consistency is adopted as a regularization to improve the generalization performance of heuristics. Details about the search algorithm is summarized in the following figure.

Extensive experimental results on $10$ molecule datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MEEA*. Moreover, for natural products, MEEA*-PC successfully identifies bio-retrosynthetic pathways for $97.68\%$ test compounds. Experiment results on each dataset is summarized in the following table:
|Dataset|Success Rate|Dataset|Success Rate|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|USPTO|$94.74\%$|logS|$80.34\%$|
|BBBP|$66.88\%$|ClinTox|$60.51\%$|
|logP|$73.72\%$|DPP4|$96.04\%$|
|BACE|$56.32\%$|Ames|$78.74\%$|
|Toxicity LD50|$72.94\%$|SVS|$73.01\%$|
